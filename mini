🔹 MODULE-WISE PROMPTS (VERY EFFECTIVE)
1️⃣ Usage Data Simulation Prompt
Copy code

Generate Python code to simulate smartphone app usage data including:
- app_name
- open_count
- session_duration
- timestamp
- user_state (study / sleep / free)

Store the data in JSON or CSV format.
2️⃣ Misuse Detection Logic Prompt
Copy code

Write Python code to detect smartphone misuse based on behavior rules such as:
- App opened more than 15 times in 1 hour
- Social media usage during study hours
- Usage after 11 PM
- Frequent short sessions (< 2 minutes)

Return misuse type and explanation.
3️⃣ ML-Based Detection Prompt (Optional)
Copy code

Create a simple machine learning model using Python that classifies usage behavior into:
- Normal
- Misuse

Use features like open frequency, session duration, and time of day.
Explain the model logic clearly.
4️⃣ Intervention Engine Prompt
Copy code

Write Python code that triggers intervention actions when misuse is detected:
- Print simulated app blocking message
- Generate delay timer
- Log intervention to database
5️⃣ Notification Prompt
Copy code

Generate user-friendly notification messages explaining misuse detection in simple language.
Example:
"You used Instagram 18 times in 40 minutes during study hours."
6️⃣ Cloud Integration Prompt
Copy code

Generate Flask API code to:
- Upload usage data to Firebase
- Retrieve misuse history
- Store intervention logs
Use mock Firebase credentials.
7️⃣ Dashboard Prompt
Copy code

Create a simple dashboard using Python (Flask + HTML) to visualize:
- App usage trends
- Misuse detection events
- Intervention frequency
📱 ANDROID-SPECIFIC PROMPT (If Needed)
Copy code

Generate Android (Java/Kotlin) code using UsageStatsManager API to monitor app usage statistics.
Explain permissions required and limitations.
Simulate app blocking where system-level blocking is not allowed.
🎓 EXAM / VIVA-FRIENDLY PROMPT
Copy code

Explain the architecture, algorithms, and novelty of a behavior-aware smartphone misuse detection system.
Compare it with traditional screen-time applications.
